Advantages over Chemical Propulsion
==================================
Electric propulsion is appealing because it enables higher specific impulse than chemical propulsion. The specific impulse of a chemical rocket depends on velocity to which a nozzle flow can be accelerated. This velocity is limited by the finite energy content of the working gas. In contrast, the particles leaving an electric thruster can be accelerated to very high velocities if sufficient electrical power is available.

In a chemical rocket, the kinetic energy of the exhaust gas is supplied by thermal energy released in a combustion reaction. For example, in the stoichiometric combustion of H\ :sub:`2` and O\ :sub:`2` releases an energy per particle of :math:`4.01 \times 10^{-19}` J, or 2.5 eV. If all of the released energy were converted into kinetic energy of the exhaust jet, the maximum possible exhaust velocity would be:

.. math::

  v_e = \sqrt{2 \frac{E}{m_{H_2O}}} = 5175 \, \mathrm{m s^{-1}}

corresponding to a maximum specific impulse of about 530 s. In practice, the most efficient flight engines have specific impulses of 450 to 500 s.

With electric propulsion, much higher energies per particle are possible. If we accelerate (singly) charged particles through a potential of 1000 V, the jet kinetic energy will be 1000 eV per ion. This is 400 times more energy per particle than is possible with chemical propulsion (or, for similar particle masses, 20 times higher specific impulse). Specific impulse in excess of  10,000 s is feasible with electric propulsion.
