Nozzle Flow
***********

The purpose of a rocket is to generate thrust by expelling mass at high velocity. A nozzle is a flow device which accelerates gas to high velocity before it is expelled from the vehicle. The nozzle accelerates the gas by converting some of the gas's thermal energy into kinetic energy.


Ideal Nozzle Flow
=================
Ideal nozzle flow is a simplified model of the aero- and thermo-dynamic behavior of fluid in a nozzle. The ideal model allows us to write algebraic relations between an engine's geometry and operating conditions (e.g. throat area, chamber pressure, chamber temperature) and its performance (e.g. thrust and specific impulse). These equations are fundamental tools for the preliminary design of rocket propulsion systems.


The assumptions of the ideal model are:
#. The fluid flowing through the nozzle is gaseous.
#. The gas is homogeneous, obeys the ideal gas law, and is calorically perfect. Its molar mass (:math:`\mathcal{M}`) and heat capacities (:math:`c_p, c_v`) are constant throughout the fluid, and do not vary with temperature.
